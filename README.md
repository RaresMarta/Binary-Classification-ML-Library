# Java Machine Learning Library

## Overview
This project is a simple **machine learning library** implemented in **Java**, featuring three classification algorithms:

- **Naïve Bayes**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Perceptron**

The library allows users to train models on a dataset, specify the **train-test split**, and evaluate classification performance using **accuracy, precision, and recall**. It includes a **graphical user interface (GUI)** for easy interaction.

## Features
- Implements **three ML algorithms**: Naïve Bayes, KNN, and Perceptron  
- Supports **binary classification**  
- Allows **custom train-test data split**  
- Provides **evaluation metrics** (Accuracy, Precision, Recall)  
- Includes a **GUI for model selection, training, and testing**
